Hi Apache Friends!

We just released a new version of XAMPP for Windows, Linux and OS X for PHP 8.2.0. You can download these new installers at [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](/download.html).

These installers include the next main components:

**8.2.0-0**

- PHP 8.2.0
- Apache 2.4.54
- MariaDB 5.4.27
- phpMyAdmin 5.2.0
- OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Windows) and OpenSSL 1.1.1s (Linux and OS X)

The [PHP version 7.4.x is now end-of-life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) but you can continue download previous versions from [SourceForge XAMPP site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/).

The OS X native installer ships x86_64 binaries that are supported by the OS X Rosetta environment for the new OS X M1 and M2 (ARM architecture). The XAMPP VM is not compatible with the ARM architecture, the OS X Rosetta environment does not translate Virtual Machine apps that virtualize x86_64 computer platforms. For this reason XAMPP does no longer support OS X VM but you can download previous versions from the [SourceForge XAMPP for OS X folder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Mac%20OS%20X/8.1.6/).

You can also contribute to the project. All the code and resources are available at the [GitHub Apache Friends](https://github.com/ApacheFriends) project. We also would like to hear your feedback to plan the next major features and improvements for the project. Please [fill this anonymous form](https://forms.gle/pYHwajDY1mLB98FV8) to help us!
